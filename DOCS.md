## Aseprite export
- Make sure that you export JSON data with frame tags and that you have at least  one tag defined. Even if there is a single animation in the file, you still need to set up frame tags.
- Exported sprite sheets must be exported as an array, not as a hash table.
- Export the sprites in the folder game/assets/sprites
